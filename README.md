MapleStory WASM is a preservation project that brings the classic MapleStory v83 experience to modern web browsers using WebAssembly. This project **patches and integrates** two separate open-source projects—a C++ client and a Java server—making them compatible and able to run together seamlessly.

---

## 🎯 Built On

This project is made possible by patching and extending the following upstream projects:

| Component | Upstream Project | Description |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Client** | [ryantpayton/MapleStory-Client](https://github.com/ryantpayton/MapleStory-Client) | A C++ MapleStory v83 client |
| **Server** | [ryantpayton/MapleStory-Server](https://github.com/ryantpayton/MapleStory-Server) | A Java MapleStory v83 server emulator |

Our patch system maintains compatibility patches on top of these repositories, enabling:
- **WebAssembly compilation** of the C++ client via Emscripten
- **Browser networking** through WebSocket proxies
- **Client-server compatibility** fixes and enhancements
- **Easy upstream updates** without maintaining forks

---

### How It Works

1. **WASM Client** - The original C++ MapleStory client is compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten, allowing it to run natively in browsers.
2. **WebSocket Proxy** - Browsers cannot make raw TCP connections, so a Python proxy bridges WebSocket connections to the Java game server.
3. **LazyFS** - A dynamic file system technology that streams game assets (`.nx` files) on-demand via WebSocket and caches them locally in your browser. Assets are only fetched from the network once, providing native loading times on subsequent loads.
4. **Patch System** - We maintain patches on top of upstream repositories, enabling easy updates without forking.

## ⚠️ Required Game Assets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **must** provide your own game assets to run this project. We cannot distribute them due to copyright.

### 1. Client Assets (`.nx` files)
Place the `.nx` files into the `assets/` directory at the project root.
- These are the same `.nx` files required by the [MapleStory-Client](https://github.com/ryantpayton/MapleStory-Client) repository.
- **Location:** `maplestory-wasm/assets/*.nx`

### 2. Server Assets (`.wz` files)
Place the original v83 `.wz` files into the `serverAssets/` directory at the project root.
- These are the same `.wz` files required by the [MapleStory-Server](https://github.com/ryantpayton/MapleStory-Server) repository.
- **Location:** `maplestory-wasm/serverAssets/*.wz`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🐳 Hosting with Docker (Recommended)

> **Only Docker is required to host the game!** No other tools needed.

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Docker** | 20.10+ | Includes Docker Compose |

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nmnsnv/maplestory-wasm.git
cd maplestory-wasm

# Start everything (Server + Web + Proxy + Database)
./scripts/run_all.sh
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser. That's it! 🎉

> **Note:** The Docker setup automatically syncs sources, applies patches, builds the WASM client, and starts all services.

---

### 🛠️ Development Setup (Manual)

<details>

#### 1. Sync & Patch Sources

```bash
# Sync upstream client and server repositories
python3 patch_system/scripts/sync.py

# Apply our patches

```

#### 2. Build the WASM Client

```bash
# Ensure Emscripten is activated
source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh

# Build the client
./scripts/build_wasm.sh

# For debug builds with symbols:
./scripts/build_wasm.sh --debug
```

#### 3. Configure & Start the Server

```bash
cd src/server

# Copy and edit configuration
cp configuration.ini.example configuration.ini
# Edit configuration.ini with your MySQL credentials

# Build and run
./launch.sh
```

#### 4. Start Web Services

```bash
# Terminal 1: HTTP Server
python web/server.py

# Terminal 2: WebSocket Proxy
python web/ws_proxy.py

# Terminal 3: Asset Server
python web/assets_server.py
```

#### 5. Play

Open **http://localhost:8000** in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
